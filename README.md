# cockpit-adsbcot — ADS-B aircraft tracking for TAK, in your browser

A [Cockpit](https://cockpit-project.org/) web console plugin for
[ADSBCOT](https://github.com/snstac/adsbcot), the **ADS-B to TAK gateway**. Track
aircraft received on **1090 MHz ADS-B and 978 MHz UAT** (RTL-SDR, readsb, dump1090-fa)
and display them in **ATAK, WinTAK, iTAK, and TAK Server** as Cursor on Target —
flight tracking and air domain awareness for aerial firefighting, search & rescue,
and airspace monitoring. Service control, `/etc/default/adsbcot` configuration,
TAK TLS certificates, and live status — no SSH required.

# Installing

Install the `.deb` from the GitHub Releases page, or `make install` compiles and installs the package in `/usr/local/share/cockpit/`.
